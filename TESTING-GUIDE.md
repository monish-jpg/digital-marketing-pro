### 8.2 Connector Categories

Verify connectors map to the right workflow categories per CONNECTORS.md:

| Category | Connectors | Skills Affected |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Communication | Slack | `/dm:send-notification` |
| Design | Canva, Figma | `/dm:ad-creative`, design assets |
| CRM | HubSpot | `/dm:crm-sync`, `/dm:lead-import`, `/dm:pipeline-update` |
| Analytics | Amplitude | `/dm:analytics-insights`, `/dm:performance-check` |
| Knowledge base | Notion | `/dm:save-knowledge`, brand docs |
| SEO | Ahrefs, Similarweb | `/dm:seo-audit`, `/dm:keyword-research`, `/dm:competitor-analysis` |
| Email marketing | Klaviyo | `/dm:send-email-campaign` |
| Calendar | Google Calendar | `/dm:content-calendar` |
| Email | Gmail | `/dm:send-report`, draft delivery |
| Payments | Stripe | `/dm:roi-calculator`, revenue data |
| Project management | Asana | `/dm:team-assign` |
| CMS | Webflow | `/dm:publish-blog` |

### 8.3 Graceful Degradation

**Test:** Invoke a skill that uses a connector that's NOT authorized/connected

**Expected:**
- [ ] Skill doesn't crash
- [ ] Clear message about which connector is needed
- [ ] Instructions on how to connect it (or suggest `/dm:connect <name>`)
- [ ] Fallback behavior (manual data input, alternative approach, or skip)
- [ ] Verify-then-guide pattern (never silent failure)

### 8.4 Platform-Level Integrations

**Test:** Verify Google Drive/Docs work through Claude platform integration (Settings > Integrations)

**Note:** Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Salesforce have NO HTTP MCP endpoints. These work through skill-guided manual workflows or npx servers (Claude Code only).
