# Changelog

All notable changes to the Digital Marketing Pro plugin are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.7.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed — Skill Budget, Agent Safety, Execution Safety

Structural quality release addressing plugin best practice audit. No feature changes — all existing functionality preserved.

#### Skill Description Optimization (141 skills)

- All 141 descriptions trimmed to <130 characters (from 130-400+) to fit within the ~15,500 char skill discovery budget
- Preserves trigger intent: "[Verb] [domain]. Use when: [triggers]." pattern
- Previously 140/141 skills exceeded convention — Claude may not have discovered all skills

#### Agent Safety (25 agents)

- `maxTurns` added to all 25 agents — prevents runaway execution
- 10 turns (5 agents), 15 turns (15 agents), 20 turns (5 agents)

#### Execution Safety

- `disable-model-invocation: true` added to `launch-plan` (total: 18 protected skills)

#### Hook Stability

- SessionStart: `timeout 30` wrapper on setup.py prevents session hang

## [2.6.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added — SEO Capability Expansion

Closes the gap with dedicated SEO tools by adding 6 new SEO sub-skills, expanded schema markup support, reference documentation, and a new MCP integration. Inspired by capabilities identified in [claude-seo](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo) — adapted to work within the full marketing system architecture with brand context, execution layer, multi-client support, and quality evaluation.

#### New Skills (6)

- **`/dm:programmatic-seo`** — Programmatic SEO at scale: data source assessment, template engine planning, URL pattern strategy, internal linking automation, thin content safeguards with quality gates (WARNING at 100 pages, HARD STOP at 500), index bloat prevention, and Google's Scaled Content Abuse policy enforcement (June 2025 / August 2025 escalation context)
- **`/dm:competitor-pages`** — SEO-optimized competitor comparison page generator: "X vs Y" pages, "alternatives to X" pages, "best tools" roundup pages, feature matrix tables. Includes Product/SoftwareApplication/ItemList schema markup, conversion-optimized CTA layouts, keyword targeting formulas, fairness guidelines, and social proof integration
- **`/dm:image-seo-audit`** — Dedicated image optimization audit: alt text quality, tiered file size thresholds (thumbnail/content/hero), format analysis (WebP/AVIF/JPEG XL status), responsive images (`srcset`/`sizes`), lazy loading validation (flags `loading="lazy"` on LCP images), `fetchpriority="high"` checks, `decoding="async"`, CLS prevention via dimensions, file naming, CDN usage
- **`/dm:page-analysis`** — Deep single-page SEO analysis: all ranking dimensions for one URL (title, meta, headings, content depth, E-E-A-T, schema detection with deprecation tracking, images, internal links, technical signals, AI search readiness). More granular than site-wide `/dm:seo-audit`. Use for landing page optimization, content refresh prioritization, or pre-publish quality checks
- **`/dm:sitemap`** — XML sitemap analysis and generation: parse existing sitemaps for issues (stale lastmod, 404s, noindex conflicts, missing URLs, protocol limit violations), or generate new sitemaps with industry-specific templates (SaaS, ecommerce, local, publisher, agency). Includes sitemap index strategy, robots.txt registration, and compression recommendations
- **`/dm:seo-plan`** — Comprehensive SEO strategy planning with industry-specific templates: discovery, competitive analysis, architecture design, content strategy, technical foundation, and 4-phase implementation roadmap (Foundation → Expansion → Scale → Authority). Templates for SaaS, ecommerce, local service, publisher/media, and agency business models

#### New Reference Files (2)

- **`schema-templates.json`** — Ready-to-use JSON-LD template library with 12 schema types: VideoObject, BroadcastEvent (LIVE badge), Clip (key moments), SeekToAction (video seek), SoftwareSourceCode, ProductGroup (e-commerce variants), ProfilePage (E-E-A-T), Certification (replaced EnergyConsumptionDetails), OfferShippingDetails, MerchantReturnPolicy, SoftwareApplication, ItemList. Includes deprecation tracker for HowTo (Sept 2023), FAQ (Aug 2023), SpecialAnnouncement (July 2025), EnergyConsumptionDetails (April 2025)
- **`google-seo-reference.md`** — Concise Google SEO quick reference for agents: Search Essentials, E-E-A-T framework (with December 2025 update extending to all competitive queries), Core Web Vitals (INP current, FID removed), schema markup status table, image SEO best practices, AI search optimization signals, spam policies including Scaled Content Abuse and Site Reputation Abuse

#### Updated — schema-generator.py

- **9 new schema types** added: BroadcastEvent, Clip, SeekToAction, SoftwareSourceCode, SoftwareApplication, ProductGroup, ProfilePage, Certification, ItemList, plus dedicated builder functions for each
- **Deprecation warnings** — Automatic warnings when generating HowTo or FAQPage schemas, citing deprecation dates and recommending alternatives
- Total supported types: 18 (was 9)

#### Updated — seo-specialist Agent

- References new skills (programmatic-seo, competitor-pages, image-seo-audit, page-seo-analysis, sitemap-manager, seo-plan) with invocation guidance
- References new reference files (google-seo-reference.md, schema-templates.json)

#### New MCP Integration

- **DataForSEO** — Live SERP data, keyword research, backlink profiles, on-page analysis, content analysis, competitor domain analysis, AI visibility checking, LLM mention tracking. 9 API modules. Added to `.mcp.json.example` with `DATAFORSEO_USERNAME` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` environment variables

### Summary

| Metric | Before (v2.5.1) | After (v2.6.0) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Skills | 135 | 141 |
| Schema types in generator | 9 | 18 |
| SEO-specific commands | ~14 | ~20 |
| MCP integrations | 67 | 68 |
| Reference files | 146 | 148 |

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-03-05

### Added — Skill Platform Enhancements

- **`argument-hint`** added to all 55 user-invocable skills — provides autocomplete hints in the Skills UI (e.g., `[URL]`, `[brand-name --full]`, `[competitor1, competitor2, ...]`)
- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** added to 17 execution skills — prevents Claude from auto-triggering skills that write to external platforms (publish, send, launch, import, export). Users must explicitly invoke these via `/dm:skill-name`
- **`evals/evals.json`** added to 3 key skills (campaign-plan, seo-audit, content-engine) — structured test cases with prompts, expected outputs, and quantitative/qualitative assertions for quality benchmarking
- **Fixed** `/dm:help` skill — added missing `name: help` field in frontmatter (required by Agent Skills spec for skill registration)

### How it works

**Argument hints** appear as placeholder text when a user types `/dm:` in the Skills UI, showing what arguments each skill accepts. For example, `/dm:seo-audit` shows `[URL]` and `/dm:campaign-plan` shows `[product/service description --budget=N]`.

**Execution safety** ensures that skills which write to external platforms (like `/dm:publish-blog`, `/dm:send-email-campaign`, `/dm:launch-ad-campaign`) cannot be triggered by Claude autonomously — the user must explicitly type the slash command. This is a critical safety layer on top of the existing MCP write approval hook.

**Evals** provide reproducible test cases for key skills. Each eval includes a realistic prompt, expected output description, and assertions that can be verified programmatically. Located at `skills/{skill-name}/evals/evals.json`.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added — Commands & Version Consistency

- **7 command files** in `commands/` directory — visible in the Customize panel "Commands" section:
  - `brand-setup` — Set up a new brand profile with voice, audience, competitors, and compliance rules
  - `campaign-plan` — Generate a multi-channel campaign plan with objectives, audience, budget, and KPIs
  - `seo-audit` — Run a comprehensive SEO audit covering technical, on-page, content, E-E-A-T, and link profile
  - `content-engine` — Draft blog posts, ad copy, emails, social, landing pages, and video scripts
  - `performance-report` — Generate marketing performance reports with KPI tracking and anomaly detection
  - `competitor-analysis` — Multi-dimensional competitive analysis across content, SEO, ads, social, and AI visibility
  - `email-sequence` — Design complete email sequences with subject lines, timing, and deliverability guidance
- **New `/dm:help` skill** — Quick reference with all commands, examples, and troubleshooting

### Fixed

- Updated stale version references across docs (getting-started.md, architecture.md, integrations-guide.md) from v2.2.0/v2.4.0 to v2.5.0

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-02-25

### Added — Connector Discovery & Onboarding

- **New `/dm:integrations` skill** — Status dashboard showing all connected vs available MCP connectors, grouped by category (CRM, SEO, advertising, email, social, etc.), with which skills each connector unlocks and quick-win recommendations
- **New `/dm:connect` skill** — Guided setup for connecting specific services (e.g., `/dm:connect google-ads`). Provides platform-specific credential instructions, `.mcp.json` configuration, and post-setup verification. Handles HTTP (OAuth) vs npx (API key) connectors differently
- **New `connector-status.py` script** — Backend for connector discovery. Maintains a registry of 45+ connectors across 17 categories, checks `.mcp.json` and environment variables to report connection status, and generates setup guides
- **Updated `CONNECTORS.md`** — Added "Managing connectors" section linking to `/dm:integrations`, `/dm:connect`, `/dm:add-integration`, and `/dm:credential-switch` skills

### How it works

Users can now discover and manage integrations interactively:
- `/dm:integrations` — "What's connected? What can I add?"
- `/dm:connect salesforce` — "Walk me through connecting Salesforce"
- `/dm:add-integration` — "I have a custom MCP server to add"

All 14 HTTP connectors auto-load on install (Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, etc.) and authenticate via OAuth on first use. The 45+ npx connectors are discoverable through these skills and require API keys.

Skills that depend on connectors already handle missing connections gracefully — they check for connectivity at startup and guide users to setup if not connected.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Added missing YAML frontmatter to `localization-specialist.md` and `quality-assurance.md` agents — without frontmatter, these agents failed to register during plugin installation, potentially causing installation rollback

## [2.3.0] — 2026-02-25

### Changed — HTTP Connector Architecture

This release rebuilds the MCP integration layer to follow Anthropic's official plugin pattern — HTTP-only connectors that work in both Cowork and Claude Code.

- **New `.mcp.json` with 14 HTTP connectors**: Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Ahrefs, Similarweb, Klaviyo, Google Calendar, Gmail, Stripe, Asana, Webflow — all `"type": "http"`, all work through Cowork's VM NAT
- **New `CONNECTORS.md`** documenting 12 connector categories with `~~category` placeholder pattern (matching Anthropic's official convention)
- **`.mcp.json.example` preserved** for Claude Code users who want the full 67-server npx configuration
- **Minimal `plugin.json`** — stripped to 4 fields (name, version, description, author) matching Anthropic's official plugin format. Removed non-standard fields: `author.title`, `author.organization`, `author.email`, `author.work_email`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`
- **Script path resolution** — `setup.py` now outputs the plugin root and scripts directory path at session start, so Claude can resolve relative script paths in both Cowork and Claude Code

### Environment Compatibility

| Feature | Cowork | Claude Code |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| 115 skills, 25 agents | Full | Full |
| HTTP connectors (14) | Full | Full |
| npx/stdio servers (67) | Not available | Full (via .mcp.json.example) |
| Python scripts (64) | Works (Python 3.10 in VM) | Full |
| Persistent brand data | Per-session | Persistent |

## [2.2.1] — 2026-02-24

### Fixed — CLI Contract & Script Bugs
- **CRITICAL: Removed undefined `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` env var** from all 22+ SKILL.md files, 23 agent files, hooks.json, and 2 documentation files — replaced with relative `scripts/` paths that work across all environments
- **Fixed CLI argument mismatches in 8 SKILL.md files** where script invocation commands did not match actual argparse definitions:
  - eval-content: `--content`/`--type` → `--text`/`--content-type`, `--composite`/`--dimensions` → `--data '{json}'`
  - verify-claims: removed non-existent `--brand` flag, `--content` → `--text`
  - validate-output: removed non-existent `--brand` flag, `--content` → `--text`, `--action detect-schema` → `--action list-schemas`
  - translate-content: `--content` → `--text`, `--source-lang`/`--target-lang` → `--source`/`--target`/`--original`/`--translated`, removed non-existent `--language`
  - localize-campaign: `--content` → `--text`, removed non-existent `--language`
  - eval-suite: `--content` → `--text`, quality-tracker `--action log --content-label --scores --suite-id` → `--action log-eval --data '{json}'`
  - prompt-test: `--content` → `--text`
  - quality-report: `--type` → `--content-type`
- **Fixed content-scorer.py keyword density bug**: multi-word keywords used substring matching (`str.count()`) instead of word-boundary matching — "AI tools" would match inside "AI toolset". Now uses `re.findall()` with `\b` word boundaries
- **Fixed hallucination-detector.py sentence splitting bug**: `re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', ...)` split on abbreviation periods (Dr., Inc., U.S.) — now requires uppercase letter after split point: `(?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z])`
- **Fixed hooks.json SessionStart**: replaced fragile compound shell command with nested subshells and `2>/dev/null` (Unix-only) with simple `python scripts/setup.py --check-deps --summary`
- **Fixed custom-mcp-guide.md**: stale "46 MCP servers" count updated to 67

### Fixed — ContentForge Plugin
- **Added YAML frontmatter** (`name` + `description`) to all 10 agent files for Claude Cowork routing compatibility
- **Replaced 5 invented MCP tool names** in Output Manager agent (`mcp_google-drive_list_folders`, `mcp_google-drive_create_folder`, `mcp_google-drive_upload_file`, `mcp_google-sheets_read_row`, `mcp_google-sheets_update_row`) with adaptive MCP approach that checks available tools at runtime

### Changed
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md verification checklist to reference `scripts/` instead of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
- Updated docs/architecture.md agent template to reference `scripts/` instead of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
