## Installation

### Connectors (MCP Integrations)

The plugin ships with **14 HTTP connectors** that work in both Cowork and Claude Code — including Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Ahrefs, Similarweb, Klaviyo, Google Calendar, Gmail, Stripe, Asana, and Webflow. These appear in the Connectors panel and users connect what they need.

**The plugin works fully WITHOUT any connectors** — all 141 skills, 25 agents, frameworks, and knowledge files function immediately. Connectors are only needed for live data and execution on external platforms.

**Claude Code users** who want the full 68-server configuration (Google Ads, Meta Ads, analytics, social, and more via npx) can use the advanced setup:

```bash
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
```

See [CONNECTORS.md](CONNECTORS.md) for the full connector reference and [MCP Integration Guide](docs/integrations-guide.md) for detailed setup.

### Option A: Install from the marketplace (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add indranilbanerjee/neels-plugins
/plugin install digital-marketing-pro@neels-plugins
```

### Option B: Direct from GitHub

```
claude plugins add github:indranilbanerjee/digital-marketing-pro
```

### Option C: Add from a local directory

```
claude plugins add /path/to/digital-marketing-pro
```

### Option C: Place in your plugins directory

Copy or clone the plugin directly into your Claude Code plugins folder:

```
~/.claude/plugins/digital-marketing-pro/
```

### Option D: Install in Claude Cowork

1. Compress the `digital-marketing-pro/` folder into a ZIP file
2. Open Cowork in Claude Desktop
3. Click **Plugin** in the left sidebar → **+** → **Upload**
4. Select the ZIP file

Or install from the [Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins) if published. See the [Claude Interfaces Guide](docs/claude-interfaces.md#installing-in-cowork) for full details.

### First-Run Setup

On first use, the plugin will:
1. Create `~/.claude-marketing/` for persistent brand data
2. Check Python dependencies (knowledge-only mode by default — no Python needed)
3. Display brand context summary (or prompt to set up your first brand)

### Python Dependencies (Optional)

The plugin works fully without any Python installation. All marketing knowledge, frameworks, agent capabilities, and slash commands work out of the box.

**Knowledge-only mode (0 MB, no install)** — Default
All 16 modules, 25 agents, 141 commands, and 148 reference knowledge files work with zero dependencies.

**Lite mode (~15 MB)** — Enables scoring scripts
```
pip install nltk textstat
```
Adds: brand voice scoring, content quality scoring, readability analysis.

**Full mode (~50 MB)** — Enables all scripts
```
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```
Adds everything in lite mode plus: competitor scraping (`beautifulsoup4`, `requests`), QR code generation, and AI visibility API checking.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Brand
```
/dm:brand-setup
```
Interactive brand profiling — answers questions about your brand identity, voice, audience, channels, and goals. Choose quick mode (5 questions) or full mode (17 questions).

### 2. Import Your Guidelines (Optional)
```
/dm:import-guidelines
```
Import your brand's voice guide, restrictions, channel styles, or messaging framework. These are enforced automatically across all content. See the [Brand Guidelines Guide](docs/brand-guidelines.md).

### 3. Start Marketing
Just talk naturally. The plugin detects intent and activates the right modules:

- "Help me plan a Q2 campaign" → Campaign Orchestrator + Marketing Strategist
- "Write a blog post about..." → Content Engine + SEO Specialist
- "How does my brand appear in ChatGPT?" → AEO/GEO Intelligence + GEO Monitoring
- "Review my landing page" → CRO + Analytics Analyst
- "We have a PR crisis" → Crisis Communication + Brand Guardian
- "Predict next quarter's revenue" → Predictive Intelligence + Marketing Scientist
- "Monitor our competitors" → Competitor Intelligence + Competitor Monitoring
- "Test this message with a focus group" → Synthetic Audience Testing

See the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) for a full walkthrough with examples.

## How It Works

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Session Start** — Plugin automatically loads your brand context:
   - Checks Python dependencies (optional — plugin works without them)
   - Displays brand summary: name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, competitors
   - Loads brand guidelines summary (rule counts, restrictions, templates, SOPs)
   - This context is available throughout the session — you do not need to re-explain your brand

2. **During the Session** — Ask for marketing help naturally:
   - Plugin matches your request to the right module(s) and agent(s)
   - Brand voice, compliance rules, industry benchmarks, and guidelines are auto-applied
   - Past campaign data and insights are checked for relevant context
   - Content is automatically checked for brand alignment and guideline compliance when written (PreToolUse hook)

3. **Session End** — Key insights auto-saved to your brand profile:
   - Marketing decisions and learnings persist across sessions
   - Plugin gets smarter about your brand over time

### Brand Context Flow

```
Session Start
  → setup.py --summary
  → Rich brand context injected (voice, industry, compliance, goals)
  → Guidelines summary loaded (restrictions, channel styles, templates, SOPs)

User Request ("write me a LinkedIn post")
  → Content Engine module activated
  → Brand voice auto-applied (formality, authority, tone)
  → Brand guidelines enforced (restrictions checked, channel style applied)
  → Compliance rules checked for target markets
  → Platform specs loaded (character limits, best practices)
  → Content created on-brand

Session End
  → Insights saved to brand profile
  → Guideline violations logged for pattern analysis
  → Available in next session
```

### Multi-Client Workflow (Agencies)

1. Create profiles per client: `/dm:brand-setup`
2. Switch clients: `/dm:switch-brand` or say "switch to [client name]"
3. All outputs instantly adapt to the active client's voice, compliance, and context
4. Each client's campaign data and insights are stored separately

See the [Multi-Brand & Agency Guide](docs/multi-brand-guide.md) for detailed workflows.

### Skill Platform Features

| Feature | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `argument-hint` | 61 skills | Autocomplete hints in the Skills UI (e.g., `[URL]`, `[brand-name --full]`) |
| `disable-model-invocation` | 18 execution skills | Prevents Claude from auto-triggering publish, send, launch, import, and export skills — user must invoke explicitly |
| `evals/evals.json` | 3 key skills | Structured test cases with prompts, expected outputs, and quantitative/qualitative assertions |

**Execution safety**: Skills that write to external platforms (publish-blog, send-email-campaign, launch-ad-campaign, schedule-social, send-report, send-sms, send-notification, data-export, data-import, crm-sync, lead-import, pipeline-update, segment-audience, seo-implement, launch-plan, publish-blog, live-dashboard) have `disable-model-invocation: true`. Claude cannot trigger these autonomously — you must type the `/dm:skill-name` command. This works alongside the MCP write approval hook for defense-in-depth.

**Evals**: The `campaign-plan`, `seo-audit`, and `content-engine` skills include `evals/evals.json` files with reproducible test cases. Each eval has a realistic prompt, expected output description, and assertions (quantitative checks like "budget totals $50,000" and qualitative checks like "uses ABM tactics for enterprise targeting").
