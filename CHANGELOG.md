# Changelog

All notable changes to the Digital Marketing Pro plugin are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [3.7.2] — 2026-05-24

**Personal-handles correction.** Patch bump — README only.

### Fixed

- The v3.7.1 "Star + share" CTA at the bottom of the maintainer section used `@neelverse` as a social-handle suggestion. That's the **product/suite brand name**, not Indranil's personal handle. Corrected to use Indranil's actual handles across LinkedIn and X:
  - **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/askneelnow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/askneelnow)
  - **X / Twitter:** [@askneelnow](https://x.com/askneelnow)

### Changed

- "About the maintainer" links block now includes LinkedIn and X rows alongside Website, GitHub, Other plugins, Discussions, and Issues — so readers can one-click follow Indranil on the platform they prefer.
- The keyword `"neelverse"` in `plugin.json` stays — it's a brand/marketplace-search keyword, not a social handle.
- "Neelverse Marketing Suite" branding throughout the README is preserved — that's the correct name for the bundle of DMP + ContentForge + SocialForge.

### Compatibility

- No functional changes. No new commands, skills, agents, scripts, or MCP connectors.
- All 4 sibling manifests bumped 3.7.1 → 3.7.2.
- Plugin version: 3.7.1 → 3.7.2 (patch — README + branding correction only).

---

## [3.7.1] — 2026-05-24

**Polish + discoverability pass.** No functional changes; no new commands, skills, agents, or scripts. Patch bump for a comprehensive README rewrite and a sweep of stale asset counts across the docs.

### Changed

#### README rewrite for organic GitHub + AI-engine discoverability

- **Hero section rewritten** — leads with a tweet-worthy one-liner positioning DM Pro as "the most comprehensive open-source AI marketing plugin" and the only one installable on 5 coding-agent surfaces. Adds GitHub stars / forks / issues / last-commit badges (live counts from shields.io), Cowork-compatible badge, EU AI Act Article 50 badge, and a "5 platforms" badge. Install command moved to the top of the document.
- **New "Why Digital Marketing Pro" section** — explicit differentiator vs ad-hoc prompts. Six-row comparison table covering canonical 12-Part Flow, Two-Views Model, Decision Matrix, Living Project Instruction File, EU AI Act readiness, 6-platform AEO/GEO audit.
- **New "What you get in 60 minutes" section** — outcome-focused list of the ~50–60 canonical files produced by `/digital-marketing-pro:engagement` with explicit API-spend range ($15–40 on Opus 4.7) and time estimate.
- **New "Installs on 5 coding-agent surfaces" matrix** — install commands per platform (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI, Antigravity) with status per platform and a one-sentence "why this works without code duplication" (Agent Skills became an open standard in Dec 2025).
- **Compliance section restructured** — adds flag emojis per jurisdiction for visual scannability, hoists EU AI Act Article 50 readiness as a sub-section with explicit C2PA + pre-publish-gate + production-cert-guide references.
- **AEO/GEO section restructured** — "6-platform audit standard" called out (was 5 before AI Mode added in v3.5). Lists exact platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Mode, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot).
- **New "About the maintainer" section** — author block with website link ([indranil.in](https://indranil.in)), GitHub, other Neelverse plugins, Discussions, Issues, and the "why this plugin exists" story.
- **New FAQ entries** — comparison vs LangChain marketing templates / CrewAI marketing crews, per-engagement API cost ($15–40), cross-platform support clarification, "is this an Anthropic product?" disambiguation.
- **⭐ Star CTAs** added at hero, maintainer section, and footer. Footer "Made with care by Indranil Banerjee · Powered by Anthropic Claude · MIT-licensed" line at bottom.
- **SEO keyword density** improved throughout — "AI marketing plugin", "Claude Code marketing", "Google AI Mode", "EU AI Act Article 50", "C2PA content provenance", "OpenAI Codex marketing", "GitHub Copilot CLI marketing", "agency operations", "multi-brand marketing", "agent skills standard".

#### Stale asset counts swept across docs

| File | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/claude-interfaces.md` | "13 specialist agents" | "25 specialist agents" |
| `docs/claude-interfaces.md` | "117 reference files" | "167 reference files" |
| `docs/claude-interfaces.md` | "34 Python scripts" | "69 Python scripts" |
| `docs/claude-interfaces.md` | "42 commands" | "10 commands" |
| `docs/claude-interfaces.md` | "18 MCP integrations" | "14 HTTP MCP connectors" |
| `docs/architecture.md` | "149 skills total" | "150 skills total" |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | "149 skills" (×3 places) | "150 skills" |
| `docs/competitor-intelligence.md` | "117 reference knowledge files" | "167 reference knowledge files" |
| `docs/cross-platform-install.md` | "71 Python scripts" (×4 places) | "69 Python scripts" |
| `skills/context-engine/memory-architecture.md` | "All 13 agents" | "All 25 agents" |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` description | "71 Python scripts, 16 industry profiles, 16 privacy-law jurisdictions" | "69 Python scripts, 16 privacy-law jurisdictions" (industry-profiles claim removed pending re-count) |

Audit method: JSON-validated all 6 manifest/config files (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `.antigravity/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`). Smoke-tested all 69 Python scripts via `python3 <script> --help` (69 pass, 0 fail). Verified all 150 SKILL.md files have valid `name:` + `description:` frontmatter. Checked all internal markdown links in README.md for broken references (none found).

#### Plugin manifest keywords expanded for GitHub + marketplace search

Added: `marketing-automation`, `marketing-plugin`, `ai-marketing`, `ai-mode`, `ai-overviews`, `generative-engine-optimization`, `answer-engine-optimization`, `google-ai-mode`, `performance-max`, `advantage-plus`, `content-strategy`, `brand-guidelines`, `gdpr`, `ccpa`, `eu-ai-act`, `article-50`, `c2pa`, `content-provenance`, `synthid`, `deepfake-disclosure`, `claude-code-plugin`, `claude-skills`, `agent-skills`, `anthropic-claude`, `openai-codex`, `cursor-plugin`, `github-copilot`, `antigravity`, `mcp`, `model-context-protocol`, `gemini`, `nano-banana-pro`, `veo-3`, `gemini-omni`, `neelverse`. Total keyword count: 26 → 61.

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes. All previous v3.7.x commands, skills, agents, scripts, and MCP connectors continue to work unchanged.
- Plugin version: 3.7.0 → 3.7.1 (patch bump — docs + branding only).
- All 4 sibling manifests bumped to 3.7.1 (`.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.antigravity/`).
- Skills count, agents count, commands count, scripts count: unchanged from v3.7.0.

---

## [3.7.0] — 2026-05-24

**Install-surface expansion: GitHub Copilot CLI (auto-discovered) + Google Antigravity 2.0 (experimental).** DM Pro now installs cleanly on five coding-agent surfaces from a single source repository — Claude Code (canonical), OpenAI Codex, Cursor (added v3.6), GitHub Copilot CLI, and Google Antigravity 2.0 (experimental). No new core dependencies; same 150 skills, same scripts, same MCP catalog.

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot CLI compatibility — no new manifest needed.** Copilot CLI's plugin discovery explicitly checks `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as one of its accepted manifest paths (alongside `.plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin.json`, and `.github/plugin/plugin.json`). DM Pro's existing Claude Code manifest is therefore directly readable by Copilot CLI. Install: `copilot plugin install indranilbanerjee/digital-marketing-pro`. The MCP catalog (`.mcp.json`), hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`), and SKILL.md auto-discovery all work natively.
- **`.antigravity/plugin.json`** — Experimental manifest for Google Antigravity 2.0 CLI (launched 19 May 2026 at Google I/O, replacing Gemini CLI). Mirrors the Gemini-CLI-extensions format that Antigravity's `agy plugin import gemini` converter accepts. Includes a `_status` field flagging the experimental nature. Will be updated against the v2-native plugin spec when Google publishes it.
- **`docs/cross-platform-install.md` — expanded** to cover all 5 platforms with: install commands, what works natively per platform, the Antigravity caveat (spec not yet public — Gemini-extensions importer is the most reliable current path), `agy plugin import gemini` workflow, update commands per platform, and where to file platform-specific bugs.

### Why Copilot CLI works without a new manifest

GitHub Copilot CLI plugin discovery (May 2026 Public Preview) is intentionally inclusive — it accepts `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin.json`, and `.github/plugin/plugin.json` interchangeably. The manifest format (name, version, description, skills, mcpServers, hooks fields) is a near-superset of Claude Code's, so the existing DM Pro manifest is directly readable. Skills, MCP, and hooks all auto-load without modification.

### Why Antigravity ships as experimental

Antigravity CLI (announced 19 May 2026) preserves Gemini CLI's plugin concepts but has not yet published an open v2-native plugin manifest spec. Third-party plugin libraries (e.g., antigravity-awesome-skills) currently distribute via Antigravity's Gemini-CLI-extensions importer (`agy plugin import gemini`). DM Pro ships an experimental `.antigravity/plugin.json` against the same format the importer accepts; when Google publishes the v2-native spec, this will be updated and the experimental flag removed.

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes for existing Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor users.
- Plugin version: 3.6.0 → 3.7.0 (minor bump — new install surfaces, no breaking changes).
- Files added: 1 (`.antigravity/plugin.json`); 1 expanded (`docs/cross-platform-install.md`).
- Skills count, agents count, commands count, scripts count: unchanged from v3.6.0.

---

## [3.6.0] — 2026-05-24

**Cross-platform compatibility pack.** Digital Marketing Pro now installs cleanly on three coding-agent surfaces from a single source repository — Claude Code (canonical), OpenAI Codex, and Cursor — by adding platform-native manifest files alongside the existing Claude Code manifest. No skill duplication: all three platforms read the same `skills/` directory, the same `scripts/`, the same `.mcp.json`, and the same `hooks/hooks.json`.

### Added

- **`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`** — OpenAI Codex plugin manifest. Includes the `interface` block (displayName, shortDescription, longDescription, category, capabilities, defaultPrompt) Codex uses to render the plugin in its install surfaces. Points at `./skills/`, `./.mcp.json`, `./hooks/hooks.json` — same directories Claude Code reads.
- **`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`** — Cursor plugin manifest. Minimal manifest (Cursor only requires `name`) plus author, repository, license, keywords, and skills path. Cursor auto-discovers `skills/` via the open SKILL.md frontmatter standard.
- **`docs/cross-platform-install.md`** — Full install guide covering all three platforms with: install commands per platform, what works natively vs what requires platform-specific configuration (notably Cursor's global mcp.json paste step), portability matrix, update commands per platform, and where to file platform-specific bugs.

### Why this works without code duplication

Agent Skills became an open standard (donated to the Agentic AI Foundation, Dec 2025; adopted by 32+ tools by May 2026). All three target platforms — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor — parse the same `name:` + `description:` SKILL.md frontmatter the same way. DM Pro's 150 skills are platform-portable as written; the v3.6.0 manifests are thin platform-specific wrappers around shared content.

### Platform-specific gotchas (documented in cross-platform-install.md)

| Gotcha | Affects | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor reads MCP from global `mcp.json` (no leading dot), not from plugin-scoped `.mcp.json` | Cursor only | One-time paste of `.mcp.json` contents into Cursor → Settings → MCP Servers (documented step) |
| Codex slash-command syntax differs (`/cmds` vs Claude Code's `/<plugin>:<command>`) | Codex only | Skills are invoked via natural-language intent on Codex; outputs are equivalent |
| Sub-agent format differs across platforms | Codex, Cursor | DM Pro skills embed agent instructions inline so outputs are equivalent on platforms without Claude Code sub-agent support |

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes for Claude Code users.
- No new dependencies — the new manifests are sibling JSON files; existing tooling untouched.
- Plugin version: 3.5.0 → 3.6.0 (minor bump — new platform surfaces, no breaking changes)
- Files added: 3 (2 manifests + 1 docs)
- Skills count, agents count, commands count, scripts count: unchanged from v3.5.0

## [3.5.0] — 2026-05-24

A May-2026-ecosystem modernisation pass covering Google I/O 2026, the active broad core algorithm update, EU AI Act draft implementing guidelines, Meta platform expansions, and Claude Code's new cost-attribution capability. No breaking changes. No new commands or skills — six discrete content updates applied across 14 existing files + 1 script.

### Changed — Six discrete content updates

#### 1. Google AI Mode added as a first-class AEO/GEO surface (5 files)

Google AI Mode (default conversational search since Google I/O on 19 May 2026, ~1B MAUs, Gemini 3.5 Flash backbone) is now tracked as a distinct platform separate from AI Overviews. The 5-platform AEO/GEO testing protocol is now 6-platform. Files updated:

- `skills/aeo-audit/SKILL.md` — Purpose section now explains the AI Mode vs AI Overviews distinction (citations diverge 40–60% for the same query)
- `skills/aeo-geo/SKILL.md` — Module trigger phrases + testing protocol updated to 6 platforms; AI Mode treated as a distinct surface in process steps
- `skills/aeo-geo/ai-visibility-audit.md` — Scoring rubric updated (max per query = 30, not 25), platform-specific notes added for AI Mode (Gemini 3.5 Flash, captures conversational follow-ups), monitoring cadence updated, baseline-normalisation guidance for pre-vs-post May 2026 score comparisons
- `skills/geo-monitor/SKILL.md` — Input "platforms to monitor" now includes AI Mode by default; output scorecard exposes the 6th surface
- `scripts/geo-tracker.py` — `PLATFORMS` list updated to include `ai-mode`; docstring clarifies the AI Mode vs AI Overviews separation. Smoke-tested via `--help`.

#### 2. May 2026 broad core algorithm update triage guidance (2 files)

Google began a broad core update on 21 May 2026 (still in the typical ~2-week deployment window when this ships). Reactive changes during/immediately after a Core Update tend to make things worse — both SEO audit skills now lead with explicit triage guidance:

- `skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md` — Purpose section adds "May 2026 Core Update context" subsection: wait for the rollout + 7–14 days settling before drawing conclusions; segment Search Console data pre/in/post rollout; Core Updates re-weight existing signals (E-E-A-T, content quality) rather than introducing new ones
- `skills/tech-seo-audit/SKILL.md` — Adds the parallel note: run the technical audit anyway (Core Updates surface pre-existing technical debt), but technical "fixes" sold as Core Update remedies won't undo a quality-driven hit

#### 3. EU AI Act Article 50 draft implementing guidelines (1 file, major addition)

The European Commission published draft Article 50 implementing guidelines on **8 May 2026**; public consultation closes **3 June 2026**; final guidelines expected July 2026 ahead of the **2 August 2026** enforcement date. Added as new sub-section §1.1b.i in `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`:

- Six-row clarification table covering: "substantial AI manipulation" definition, "matters of public interest" scope, machine-readable marking (C2PA = presumption of compliance), deepfake visible-disclosure requirements (perceivable at normal viewing distance), editorial-responsibility carve-out conditions, and enforcement priorities
- Five-point action list: audit EU AI-asset inventory now, file consultation comment by 3 June if materially affected, lock in C2PA signing-cert procurement (Adobe approval = 2–4 weeks; start by 1 July), update Definition of Done so creative is C2PA-signed at production time, treat the human-review carve-out as conditional (named accountability required)

#### 4. Meta platform updates — Advantage+ Leads global, Threads ads global, brand-safety controls (1 file)

Three May 2026 Meta updates added to `skills/context-engine/execution-workflows.md` Section 3 (Ad Campaign Workflow):

- **Advantage+ Leads** — now globally available; only works well with Conversions API + CRM-quality feedback; not compatible with Special Ad Categories (housing/credit/employment)
- **Threads ads** — global rollout completing May 2026; image-only formats only; cheap-to-moderate inventory; best for younger / news-adjacent / B2B-thought-leadership; cap at <10% of Meta budget until account-level CPA proves out
- **Brand-safety inventory filters** — three tiers (Expanded/Moderate/Limited); default Moderate; move to Limited only for regulated industries or after a documented incident (Limited costs ~30% reach); Brand Suitability dashboard now exposes Reels topic adjacencies

#### 5. Gemini Omni + Nano Banana Pro + Veo 3.1 in AI creative briefs (4 files)

Added an "AI image & video generation guidance (May 2026)" sub-section to four creative-production skills, with consistent C2PA-by-default and Article 50 disclosure clauses:

- `skills/ad-creative/SKILL.md` — Asset-type-to-model table (Nano Banana Pro for stills with on-image text, Veo 3.1 for short-form video, Gemini Omni for connected multimodal packages); workflow recommendation to hand visual spec to SocialForge `/sf:image` and `/sf:video`
- `skills/content-brief/SKILL.md` — Visual/media spec requires explicit model, provenance marking, deepfake flag, and editorial-responsibility owner for YMYL topics
- `skills/creative-testing-framework/SKILL.md` — AI creative variant production note: cost-per-variant becomes the new floor for minimum-budget math; EU-targeted ad sets blocked unless C2PA-signed
- `skills/influencer-brief/SKILL.md` — Three explicit AI-tool clauses for creator contracts: permitted AI use, required platform disclosures, EU deepfake clause (mandatory for EU placements)

#### 6. Claude Code v2.1.149+ `/usage` per-model breakdown (2 files)

Claude Code v2.1.149 (May 2026) exposes per-model token consumption and projected USD cost via `/usage`. For agencies, this is the cleanest brand-attributable AI-cost source.

- `docs/claude-interfaces.md` — New "Cost tracking" section under Claude Code (Full Support) documenting `/usage`, `/usage --since 7d`, per-directory scoping, and the operational implications for 12-Part engagement billing and Opus-1M context tradeoffs
- `skills/agency-dashboard/SKILL.md` — Process step 8 (team utilization) now pulls `/usage --since 7d` per brand directory; output adds "Claude Code consumption (per brand)" line flagging brands at >2× portfolio median for retainer-tier rate review

### Compatibility

- No breaking changes. All previous v3.4.x commands, skills, agents, scripts, and MCP connectors continue to work unchanged.
- `geo-tracker.py` now accepts `ai-mode` as a platform argument (previously: rejected with argparse error).
- Historical GEO scores baselined pre–May 2026 should be normalised ×1.2 OR rerun against the 6-platform set before comparison. See `skills/aeo-geo/ai-visibility-audit.md`.

### Auditor notes

- Plugin version: 3.4.2 → 3.5.0 (minor bump — new feature surface for AI Mode + Article 50 draft + Gemini Omni; no breaking changes)
- Files modified: 15 (14 SKILL/docs + 1 script)
- Skills count, agents count, commands count: unchanged from v3.4.2

---

## [3.4.2] — 2026-05-17

### Added — Three documentation expansions (no code changes; no breaking changes)

#### 1. Opus 4.7 1M-context guidance in `skills/engagement-workflow/SKILL.md`

The full 12-part engagement (50–60 documents, 250K–600K tokens) now fits in a single conversation when running on Opus 4.7 with the 1M context window (generally available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users as of May 2026). New section documents:

- When 1M context is available: skip LIF re-load between parts, run Parts 1–8 sequentially in one conversation, dispatch Part 9 channel families in parallel, complete Parts 10–12 in the same conversation
- When 1M context is NOT available (Pro tier, third-party API access, batch mode): use the existing engagement-state.py persistence pattern; chunk by Part; re-load LIF at each transition
- The local persistence pattern stays the default — it's correct in both worlds and the only one that works for multi-day / multi-author engagements

#### 2. WhatsApp Business voice calling in `skills/context-engine/india-market-context.md`

WhatsApp Business now supports brand-to-customer voice calls in/out of WhatsApp (May 2026 launch). Use cases: high-AOV consult (real estate, automotive, financial services), post-purchase support, B2B account management. Practical guidance: pilot with a single use case rather than treating it as a broadcast channel; voice calls preserve the 24-hour customer-care window for the next 24 hours after the call ends.

#### 3. May 2026 platform updates in `skills/context-engine/execution-workflows.md` Section 3 (Ad Campaign Workflow)

- **Google Performance Max 2026:** brand exclusion lists first-class, per-network placement reporting exposed, first-party audience exclusions, 15 videos per asset group (was 5), PMax experiments. The old "black box" criticism is mostly addressed.
- **Meta Advantage+ shopping 2026:** in-app checkout, AI product overlays on hover, retailer integrations standard. Creative at product-tile scale, not full-frame. Catalog quality dominates performance.
- **LinkedIn Ads:** March 2026 algorithm shift carries into ad relevance — ads with external links score lower than in-platform formats (lead gen forms, document ads, conversation ads).
- **TikTok Ads (post-USDS Jan 2026):** US-served ads run through USDS LLC infrastructure; AI-generated creative requires AI disclosure label.
- **Retail media (Amazon, Walmart, Instacart):** combined US spend ~$60B+/year in 2026. Worth a campaign track for DTC + CPG brands.

#### 4. New `docs/roadmap-multiagent-sessions-api.md`

Planning document for v3.5 / v4.0 — how DMP would adopt Anthropic's Multiagent Sessions API + Memory for Managed Agents API (both in public beta under the `managed-agents-2026-04-01` Messages API beta header). Three-phase plan: (A) v3.5 dual-write opt-in path, (B) v4.0 flip default to managed-agents with local-file fallback, (C) v4.1+ long-running engagements as managed sessions. Open questions documented: pricing, Cowork compatibility, cross-API-provider availability, migration story. No code in v3.4.2 implements any of this — it's a planning artifact.

### Rationale

User asked what's worth doing next from the May 2026 reality. These three documentation expansions are the small, low-risk content adds; the multi-agent roadmap is the longer-term direction setter. Bundled into one patch release rather than three separate ones because none of them ship code.

---

## [3.4.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed — Audit & corrections pass on v3.4.0

User explicitly asked whether the v3.4 work had been audited. Answer: no. Ran a real audit. Found four issues, fixed all four.

#### (1) C2PA script — actually works now

**Problem:** v3.4.0 `scripts/embed-c2pa.py` called `c2pa.create_signer(...)` and `c2pa.sign_file(...)` as top-level module functions. Neither exists in c2pa-python 0.32.6 (the current library). Script would have failed at runtime the first time a user invoked `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata`.

**Fix:**
- Rewrote against the real API: `c2pa.Signer.from_info(C2paSignerInfo(...))` → `c2pa.Builder(manifest_json)` → `builder.sign_file(source, dest, signer)`.
- Fixed `C2paSignerInfo` field types (`c_char_p` ctypes — alg=b"es256", cert_bytes, key_bytes, b"http://timestamp.digicert.com").
- Switched manifest assertions label from `c2pa.actions` to `c2pa.actions.v2` (current spec).
- Bound `digital_source_type` via `builder.set_intent(C2paBuilderIntent.CREATE, C2paDigitalSourceType.{TRAINED_ALGORITHMIC_MEDIA|COMPOSITE_WITH_TRAINED_ALGORITHMIC_MEDIA|HUMAN_EDITS})` rather than embedding raw IPTC URIs in the manifest.
- Fixed the self-signed dev cert to include the certificate extensions C2PA requires: BasicConstraints(ca=false, critical), KeyUsage(digital_signature=true, critical), ExtendedKeyUsage(EMAIL_PROTECTION), SubjectKeyIdentifier, AuthorityKeyIdentifier. Without these the C2PA library rejects with "the certificate is invalid".
- Fixed the read-back verification to use `c2pa.Reader(format, stream)` context manager — the prior `Reader.from_file` API doesn't exist either.

**Verified end-to-end:** 75-byte test PNG → 42,818-byte signed PNG. Read-back confirms `active_manifest` ID, title, signer ("Digital Marketing Pro"), cert algorithm "Es256", assertions `["c2pa.actions.v2", "stds.schema-org.CreativeWork"]`, action `c2pa.created (Test Generator)`, CreativeWork.author `[{"@type": "Organization", "name": "Test Brand"}]`. `manifest_embedded_and_verified: true`. Validation state shows "Invalid" only because self-signed certs aren't in C2PA's trust list — production CAI-issued certs validate as "Valid".

#### (2) Unified ads MCP entries — corrected endpoints + coverage

Prior research agent told me Synter endpoint was `https://mcp.synter.com/sse` covering 14 platforms, and Ryze was `https://mcp.ryze.ai/mcp`. Neither matches reality.

**Fix:**
- **Synter (real name: Synter Media AI):** corrected endpoint `https://mcp.syntermedia.ai/mcp/` with `X-Synter-Key` header auth. Platform coverage corrected from claimed 14 to actual 7: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Microsoft Ads, Reddit Ads, TikTok Ads, X. Source: `github.com/Synter-Media-AI/mcp-server`. Renamed entry from `synter` to `synter-media-ai`.
- **Ryze AI:** corrected entry — it's primarily a managed OAuth connector service at `app.get-ryze.ai/mcp-connector`, not a generic self-serve HTTP MCP. The Google Ads per-platform endpoint is `https://ryze-google-ads-mcp-kyfjuf4chq-uc.a.run.app/mcp`. Coverage clarified: Google Ads primary; separate per-platform connectors for Meta and Google Analytics via the managed OAuth service. Renamed entry from `ryze-ai` to `ryze-ai-google-ads`.
- **Northbeam:** corrected GitHub URL to `github.com/mattcoatsworth/Northbeam-MCP-Server` (community-maintained, NOT first-party from Northbeam Inc — the prior reference implied otherwise). Platform coverage (Google + Meta + LinkedIn + TikTok) verified. Renamed entry from `northbeam-selfhosted` to `northbeam-mcp-selfhosted`.
- Added explicit caveat at top of `_section_unified_ads_mcps`: "Endpoint URLs and platform-coverage claims below were verified May 2026 — re-verify before production use as these are early-stage services."
- `CONNECTORS.md` "Unified ads MCPs" table updated with the corrected URLs, auth, and source-repo links.

#### (3) Parallel-dispatch speedup claim — softened from overstated to honest

**Problem:** v3.4.0 claimed flat "~6× wall-clock speedup" across multiple surfaces (CHANGELOG, README, plugin.json, marketplace.json, engagement-workflow SKILL, competitor-analysis command, seo-audit command). Published Anthropic guidance is more nuanced: 4–6× parallelism with 50–80% wall-clock reduction for 3–8 concurrent subagents; past 8 you queue against rate limits and the win drops; under 3 there's nothing to parallelize.

**Fix:**
- `skills/engagement-workflow/SKILL.md`: replaced overclaim with "4–6× parallelism with roughly 50–80% wall-clock reduction for 3–8 concurrent subagents" + cost note ("total token usage is broadly similar; billed-per-turn input costs trend up slightly because each parallel subagent re-loads its context") + the queue-after-8 caveat.
- `commands/competitor-analysis.md`: changed "parallel → ~6 min wall-clock" to "parallel dispatch reduces this by 50–80% wall-clock per Claude Code's April 2026 parallel-subagent initialization — typical run lands at ~7–17 min (rate-limit dependent)".
- `commands/seo-audit.md`: changed "parallel ~5 min wall-clock" to "parallel dispatch typically lands at ~5–12 min wall-clock (rate-limit dependent) — roughly 50–80% reduction".

#### (4) Submission URLs — removed unverified URL

**Problem:** `SUBMISSION.md` referenced two submission URLs: `https://claude.ai/settings/plugins/submit` (consumer) and `https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit` (Console). Only the second is verifiable in Anthropic's public docs as of May 2026.

**Fix:** Removed `claude.ai/settings/plugins/submit` references from SUBMISSION.md introduction and the 12-step submission flow. Sole submission URL is now `https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit`.

### Rationale

User explicitly pushed back on the previous turn's "ship-fast, verify-later" pattern. Audit found exactly the kind of issues that pattern produces: a Python script that won't run, MCP endpoint URLs that don't resolve, performance claims that misrepresent published Anthropic guidance, and a submission URL that may not exist. All four fixed in v3.4.1. The C2PA script is now end-to-end empirically tested — signing succeeds, manifest reads back round-trip, all assertion fields verified.

---

## [3.4.0] — 2026-05-16

### Added — The Four Deferred Items from v3.3 audit

User asked why these were deferred. Answer: sequencing — content/regulatory drift was bleeding trust and shipped first. They're now in.

#### 1. C2PA content provenance (EU AI Act Article 50 compliance)

- **New script** `scripts/embed-c2pa.py` (~250 lines) wrapping `c2pa-python>=0.5.0`. Embeds machine-readable provenance manifests into AI-generated images / video / audio / PDF. Supports `.png .jpg .jpeg .webp .gif .tiff .mp4 .mov .webm .mp3 .wav .pdf`.
- **New skill** `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata` at `skills/c2pa-metadata/SKILL.md`. Full doc with usage examples, IPTC digital-source-type vocabulary mapping (ai-generated-content / ai-assisted-edits / ai-no-substantive-changes), signing-certificate guidance (CAI-recognized authority for prod; auto-generated 90-day self-signed cert for dev).
- **Pre-publish gate integration** — `/digital-marketing-pro:check` now treats missing/invalid C2PA manifest on AI-flagged assets in EU-targeted campaigns as a CRITICAL issue (BLOCKED decision). Wired through `commands/check.md`.
- **Compliance rule binding** — new `Section 1.1b EU/EEA — AI Act Article 50 (Generative AI Disclosure)` in `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md` documents the regulatory basis, applicability date (2 Aug 2026), penalty (€15M or 3% global turnover), and how the c2pa-metadata skill satisfies the marking requirement.
- **requirements.txt updated** with optional `c2pa-python>=0.5.0` and `cryptography>=42.0` (commented; install only when needed).
- Output is verifiable at https://contentcredentials.org/verify and any C2PA-aware viewer (Photoshop, Lightroom, Truepic).

#### 2. Unified ads-platform MCPs

- **New `_section_unified_ads_mcps` in `.mcp.json.connectors-reference`** documenting three purpose-built MCPs:
  - **Synter** — 14 platforms in one (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat, X, Microsoft, Taboola, Outbrain, Quora, Spotify, Amazon Ads)
  - **Ryze AI** — Google + Meta + GA4 with confirmation patterns
  - **Northbeam (self-hosted)** — Google + Meta + LinkedIn + TikTok, open-source, BYO OAuth
- **CONNECTORS.md updated** with a new "Unified ads MCPs (added v3.4)" section and a callout on the Advertising row in the npx-only table directing users to the unified options.
- All three are HTTP — fully Cowork-compatible. Replaces the per-platform stdio servers in `.mcp.json.example` for teams who want one ads tool surface instead of four.

#### 3. Parallel subagent dispatch

Leverages Claude Code's **April 2026 parallel-subagent initialization**. Realistic speedup: 4–6× parallelism with ~50–80% wall-clock reduction for 3–8 concurrent subagents (past 8 you queue against rate limits). See v3.4.1 entry above for corrected per-command numbers.

- **`skills/engagement-workflow/SKILL.md`** — new "Parallel Dispatch" section identifies Parts 2 (External Research), 4 (Competitive + Customer + Market), 9 (Channel Strategy Fan-out), 10 (Execution Artefacts), 11 (AI Creative Instructions) as parallel-eligible, with explicit subagent-dispatch instructions. Parts 1→2, 3→4, 5→6, 7→8, 8→9 remain sequential (real data dependencies). New Quality Discipline rule #6: "Always parallelize independent work."
- **`commands/competitor-analysis.md`** — 7 dimensions (content, SEO, paid ads, social, AI visibility, pricing, positioning) dispatched in one message with 7 parallel Task calls. ~35 min sequential → ~6 min parallel. Multi-competitor analyses sequence competitors but parallelize dimensions within each.
- **`commands/seo-audit.md`** — 6 dimensions (technical, on-page, content, E-E-A-T, link profile, AEO) parallel; aggregation + impact-to-effort prioritization sequential. ~25 min sequential → ~5 min parallel.
- **`commands/content-engine.md`** — per-format drafting parallel when multiple formats requested from one brief (blog + 3 socials + email + ad copy → 6 parallel Task calls); SME calibration + quality gate + aggregation sequential.
- **`commands/campaign-plan.md`** — per-channel briefs parallel after channel-mix approval; KPI tree + attribution + reporting cadence parallel in the measurement layer; budget allocation sequential.

#### 4. Anthropic Software Directory submission packet

- **New `SUBMISSION.md` at repo root** pre-stages every input the directory form requires: one-line + long description, category, target audience, 4 working use cases, testing-account/sample-data declaration, ownership verification, compliance-with-policy checklist, Cowork compatibility statement, Verified-badge candidacy assessment, screenshot checklist, step-by-step submission instructions.
- Reduces actual submission at https://claude.ai/settings/plugins/submit from a multi-hour task to ~5 minutes.
- Maintained in the repo so it can be refreshed each release before re-submission.

### Changed

- Skill count bumped from 149 → **150** (new c2pa-metadata skill).
- Script count bumped from 70 → **71** (new embed-c2pa.py script).
- Plugin description in plugin.json + marketplace.json updated to lead with the four v3.4 additions.

### Rationale

The four deferred items from the v3.3 audit aren't optional polish — C2PA is a hard regulatory requirement for EU markets in 81 days (2 Aug 2026); unified ads MCPs eliminate connector sprawl that's been the #2 user complaint; parallel dispatch makes the 12-part engagement viable inside a single conversation rather than an hour-long wait; the directory submission packet is the path to discoverability beyond word-of-mouth.

## [3.3.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added — May 2026 Modernization Sweep

Comprehensive refresh against current marketing/regulatory/AI-search reality. **Content + documentation release** — no breaking changes to skills, agents, or scripts.

#### Privacy & Compliance updates (16-jurisdiction matrix)

- **EU AI Act Article 50 (applicable 2 Aug 2026)** — generative-AI marketing content must carry machine-readable C2PA-style watermarks; deepfakes must be visibly disclosed; AI-generated text on matters of public interest must be disclosed. Penalty up to €15M or 3% global turnover.
- **DPDP Phase II preparation (effective 13 Nov 2026)** — consent-manager framework registration window opens. Phase III hard enforcement 13 May 2027 with INR 2.5B max penalty.
- **NY synthetic-performer disclosure law (live June 2026)** — $1K–$5K per violation, $10K repeat. Synthetic influencers and AI-generated endorsements flagged.
- **FTC May 2026 endorsement guidance** — covers synthetic influencers, AI testimonials, AI-edited creator content.
- **CJEU March 2026 ruling** — pseudonymized cookie IDs are personal data when re-identification is feasible.
- **CCPA/CPRA Jan 2026 amendments** — neural networks and AI-derived personal data classified as sensitive. ADMT compliance (Jan 1 2027) flagged.

#### Channel guidance updates

- **LinkedIn (March 2026 algorithm shift)** — external links and engagement bait penalized ~60%; new Depth Score measures dwell time. `social-strategy` and content-engine LinkedIn guidance updated.
- **Email** — Apple MPP affects ~64% of B2C opens; open rate dropped as primary KPI. **DMARC + RFC 8058 one-click POST unsubscribe** mandatory; non-compliant bulk mail to Gmail/Yahoo/Microsoft gets permanent 550 rejections. Spam threshold tightened to <0.10%.
- **TikTok (post Jan 22 2026 USDS Joint Venture closing)** — US data and algorithm under USDS LLC. AI-generated creators allowed only with disclosure; AI content excluded from Creator Rewards Program. Daily shoppable-post limits effective May 11 2026.
- **WhatsApp (per-message pricing since 1 July 2025)** — corrected from deprecated conversation-based model in 3 skill files: `skills/context-engine/execution-workflows.md`, `skills/context-engine/india-market-context.md`, `skills/emerging-channels/conversational-commerce.md`. India marketing template ≈ USD 0.0118 per message. 72-hour free service window from CTWA ads or Page CTAs.
- **Schema strategy refresh** — Google's March 2026 core update demoted FAQ/Review/HowTo schema on non-primary pages. Skills now emphasize entity-rich JSON-LD and produce an LLMs.txt companion file.
- **Sora deprecation note** — OpenAI's consumer Sora app discontinues April 26 2026; Sora API September 24 2026. AI creative briefs default to Runway Gen-4 / Veo 3.x / Kling 3.0.
- **Third-party cookies — deprecation cancelled** — Chrome formally abandoned the timeline. The `attribution-model` skill defaults to first-party + MMM + incrementality stack.

#### AEO / GEO modernization

- Google AI Overviews now appear on ~55% of all Google searches. Organic CTR on AI Overview queries dropped ~61%. ~58% of searches are zero-click.
- Citation-tracking guidance updated for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, Bing Copilot, Gemini.
- For ongoing measurement, integrate with **Profound / Otterly / Conductor AgentStack** via the connectors layer.
- **Share of AI Voice** as a first-class metric in `/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report`.

#### README + Top Commands fixes

- **README fully restructured** to ContentForge v3.9.5 pattern: Quick Start at top with install + auto-update toggle as steps 1-2; "Where your files go" section showing the 12-part engagement directory layout; version histories collapsed at the bottom.
- **Top Commands table corrected** — was using bare `/brand-setup` form that conflicts with other plugins. Now uses canonical `/digital-marketing-pro:brand-setup`.
- **Duplicate "Option C" install heading fixed** (was Option C twice instead of A/B/C/D).
- **Top version badge bumped** from 3.2.0 → 3.3.0 (was two patches stale).
- **Auto-update guidance** — explicit two-option flow (toggle vs manual uninstall+reinstall) since third-party marketplaces have auto-update OFF by default.
- **Cowork install correctness** — Cowork is the Anthropic Desktop computer-use product with local filesystem access; full DM Pro pipeline including all 70 Python scripts runs natively. Only Cowork-specific limitation is HTTP MCPs only.
- **Script count corrected** from "68 Python scripts" to actual file count of 70.
- **Two PDF references at repo root** documented (`DM_Strategy_Complete_Learning_Guide.pdf` and `DM_Strategy_Flow_v3_2_Visualization_v1_23Apr26.pdf`).

### Rationale

Marketing tech moves quarterly. A plugin that documents WhatsApp's per-conversation pricing (deprecated July 2025) or treats email open rate as a primary KPI (Apple MPP affects 64% of B2C opens) erodes user trust. v3.3 brings DM Pro's content surface up to the May 2026 reality.

---

## [3.2.2] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed — Slash Command Namespace Consistency

All `/dm:` references in docs and runtime files swept to the canonical `/digital-marketing-pro:` form that Claude Code auto-namespacing actually produces. The `/dm:` shorthand was used in ~600 places across README, getting-started, TESTING-GUIDE, engagement-methodology, multi-brand-guide, brand-guidelines, architecture, v3.2-opt-ins, all agent files, all 149 skill SKILL.md files, command files, and the CHANGELOG. Users can now copy-paste any command from any doc and have it work.

The replacements include agent files (content-creator, email-specialist, social-media-manager, pr-outreach, quality-assurance, seo-specialist) which emit slash command recommendations during execution. Before this release, agents may have been emitting commands that didn't match the documented namespace.

Skill filenames preserved.

No behavioral changes. If `/dm:` shortcuts work in your environment they'll continue to work; this just makes the docs match the documented Claude Code namespace pattern.

---

## [3.2.1] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed — Plugin Manifest Install Format (CRITICAL)

The plugin manifest format that v3.0 inherited (and v3.1.1 / v3.2.0 carried forward) used two fields that Claude Code's plugin schema does not accept, causing `claude plugins install digital-marketing-pro` to fail with "the manifest's `repository` field is an object when Claude Code expects a string." This release fixes both issues so install works.

#### Changes

- **`repository` field**: converted from npm-shorthand object form (`{type: "git", url: "..."}`) to the string URL form Claude Code's plugin schema requires. New value: `"https://github.com/indranilbanerjee/digital-marketing-pro.git"`.
- **`$schema` field removed**: Claude Code's plugin schema parser rejects this top-level key. Editor validation benefit isn't worth a broken install.

Same fixes shipped same-day to ContentForge v3.9.2, SocialForge v1.5.2, and marketplace v2.8.0.

### Migration

Pure manifest fix. No behavioral changes; the v3.2 12-Part Methodology + opt-in safety nets continue to work identically.

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added — Closing the v3.1 Hook-Removal Gaps

v3.1 removed all four global hooks for multi-plugin coexistence (the `PreToolUse mcp_.*` matcher in particular was intercepting every MCP call from every installed plugin). That fix was correct, but it left real gaps — most notably, the loss of automatic hallucination detection on every Write/Edit operation. v3.2 closes those gaps with explicit on-demand replacements, agent-embedded safety, and opt-in ambient capture — without bringing back the global-scoping problem.

#### New: `/digital-marketing-pro:check` — explicit pre-publish quality gate

Replaces the `PreToolUse Write|Edit` global hook. Wraps `scripts/eval-runner.py` (the master eval orchestrator) and produces a single PASS / WARN / BLOCKED decision with actionable issues. Three modes:

- `/digital-marketing-pro:check <file>` → quick eval (~2s, no external deps): hallucination + content quality + readability
- `/digital-marketing-pro:check <file> --full --brand <slug>` → full 6-dimension eval including brand voice + claims + structure
- `/digital-marketing-pro:check <file> --compliance --brand <slug> --evidence <facts.json> --schema <name>` → compliance-focused for regulated industries

New files:
- `commands/check.md`
- `skills/check/SKILL.md`

#### New: `/digital-marketing-pro:status` — unified on-demand brand snapshot

Replaces the `SessionStart` global hook (which printed a brand summary banner at every Claude Code launch in every project). Richer than the old banner: brand profile, all engagements with current part + days-since-update + pending decisions + versioned doc count, recent insights with last-save age, recent compliance violations, Python dependency mode. Five subcommand modes:

- `/digital-marketing-pro:status` → full snapshot for active brand
- `/digital-marketing-pro:status --quiet` → one-line compact summary
- `/digital-marketing-pro:status --json` → machine-readable JSON for downstream skills
- `/digital-marketing-pro:status --brand <slug>` → snapshot for a specific brand
- `/digital-marketing-pro:status --section <brand|engagements|insights|compliance|deps>` → single section

New files:
- `commands/status.md`
- `skills/status/SKILL.md`
- `scripts/dm-status.py` (560-line script; reads brand profile + engagement state + insights + violations + deps; never modifies state)

#### Embedded mandatory hallucination check in 4 content-producer agents

Replaces the `PreToolUse Write|Edit` global hook with stronger architectural guarantees. Each agent now runs `hallucination-detector.py` on its final draft before delivering content to the user. Severity-based decision rules:
- `severity: "high"` (placeholder URLs, fabricated stats in headlines, made-up academic citations, unsupported "#1" / "best in industry" / "leading" claims) → DO NOT deliver; return issues + suggested fixes
- `severity: "medium"` (unverified body stats, missing hedging, entities-to-verify) → deliver but include warnings inline
- `severity: "low"` → mention; not blocking
- Overall hallucination_score < 60 → flag for revision (PR content uses stricter < 75 threshold)

This is stronger than the v3.0 hook because (a) the check runs on the actual draft the agent intends to deliver, not on every intermediate Write/Edit; (b) the agent has the context to interpret findings appropriately; (c) the check is part of the agent's deliverable contract, not an external gate.

Agents updated:
- `agents/content-creator.md` — Behaviour Rule 12 added
- `agents/email-specialist.md` — Behaviour Rule 11 added
- `agents/social-media-manager.md` — Behaviour Rule 11 added
- `agents/pr-outreach.md` — Behaviour Rule 10 added (with stricter PR-specific thresholds)

#### New: `auto_save_insights` opt-in flag for ambient learning capture

Replaces the `SessionEnd` global hook (which auto-prompted insight saving on every session end across every project). Opt-in per brand:

```json
{
  "auto_save_insights": true,
  "...": "...rest of brand profile..."
}
```

When enabled, marketing agents call `scripts/auto-save-insight.py` at meaningful checkpoints to persist session learnings. When disabled (default), the helper returns `{"status": "no_op"}` — clean no-op, no surprise side effects, no cross-project noise.

New file: `scripts/auto-save-insight.py` (240-line helper with subcommands: save, save with `--force`, `--dry-run`; falls back to direct `insights.json` write if `campaign-tracker.py` cannot resolve the brand).

Atomic writes; honours `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` env var; respects the same workspace path as `dm-status.py` and `engagement-state.py`.

#### New: `docs/v3.2-opt-ins.md` — comprehensive opt-in guide

Documents:
- What was lost when v3.1 removed each of the four global hooks
- How to re-enable any hook at the user-level (`~/.claude/settings.json`) or project-level (`.claude/settings.local.json`) — this gives users the v3.0 ambient experience without forcing it on the entire plugin user base
- Why the `PreToolUse mcp_.*` matcher should NOT be re-enabled (it intercepts every MCP call from every plugin)
- How `auto_save_insights` works and when to enable it
- How `/digital-marketing-pro:status` and `/digital-marketing-pro:check` map to the removed hooks
- How the embedded agent check is stronger than the v3.0 hook
- Recommended workflow for minimum / opt-in / power-user / project-scoped configurations

#### Plugin manifest

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bumped to v3.2.0 with updated description surfacing the new commands, agent updates, opt-in flag, and hook re-enable pattern.

### Compatibility

- All v2.7 + v3.0 + v3.1 capabilities continue to work unchanged
- New skills and scripts are purely additive
- The `auto_save_insights` flag defaults to `false` — opt-in only; existing brand profiles without the flag get no behavioural change
- Hook re-enabling is documented as a user-side action; the plugin still ships zero global hooks

### Migration

No migration needed. To start using the new compensations:

```
# On-demand status snapshot
/digital-marketing-pro:status

# Pre-publish quality gate
/digital-marketing-pro:check drafts/your-content.md --brand <your-slug>

# Enable ambient insight capture (opt-in per brand)
# Edit ~/.claude-marketing/brands/<your-slug>/profile.json:
#   "auto_save_insights": true

# Re-enable v3.0 SessionStart banner at user level (optional)
# Copy SessionStart block from hooks/hooks-reference.example.json into ~/.claude/settings.json
# (Do NOT re-enable the PreToolUse mcp_.* matcher — see docs/v3.2-opt-ins.md)
```

## [3.1.1] — 2026-05-03

### Added — Cowork-Compatible Connectors Reference Catalog

The v3.1.0 audit confirmed DMP runs in Anthropic Cowork, but surfaced a documentation gap: the `.mcp.json.example` file ships ~60 stdio/npx MCP servers (Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Google Ads, Meta Marketing, Mailchimp, LinkedIn, TikTok, Salesforce, etc.) — none of which work in Cowork. Cowork users had no documented HTTP path to these services. v3.1.1 adds a reference catalog of HTTP MCP equivalents.

#### New file: [.mcp.json.connectors-reference](.mcp.json.connectors-reference)

Sectioned catalog of 25+ HTTP MCPs covering DMP's full integration surface:

- **First-party marketing MCPs** (already in active `.mcp.json`): HubSpot, Stripe, Klaviyo, Amplitude, Ahrefs, Similarweb — all OAuth, all Cowork-compatible
- **Collaboration & publishing**: Notion, Slack, Asana, Webflow, Canva, Figma, Gmail, Google Calendar
- **Aggregator MCPs for Cowork** — the critical addition. Pipedream entries for Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Google Ads, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Meta Marketing, Mailchimp, LinkedIn, Salesforce, plus a generic template covering Pipedream's 1000+ services. Composio (`https://connect.composio.dev/mcp`), Zapier (`https://mcp.zapier.com/api/v1/connect`), and Make.com as alternatives
- **Image/video generation**: fal-ai, Replicate (covers Stability, Gemini Imagen, FLUX, Recraft, etc.)

Per-entry `_auth` notes document the OAuth flow or API key requirement. Bottom-of-file `_cowork_compatibility_summary` makes the CLI-vs-Cowork mapping explicit.

#### What this means for users

- **Claude Code CLI users**: nothing changes. `.mcp.json.example` still documents the 60+ stdio/npx options, and the active `.mcp.json` (gitignored) still ships the 14 HTTP MCPs you've already configured.
- **Cowork users**: open `.mcp.json.connectors-reference` instead of `.mcp.json.example`. Every category has a Cowork-compatible HTTP path, either via a first-party MCP or via a Pipedream/Composio/Zapier aggregator.

#### Compliance posture

All listed connectors satisfy the [Anthropic Software Directory Policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13145358-anthropic-software-directory-policy): no financial-transaction processing, no advertising delivery, no safety circumvention. All MCPs use OAuth 2.0 or API key auth via the provider's official endpoint.

### Migration

Pure additive release. No breaking changes. Existing connector setups continue to work. Cowork teams gain a documented path for every category previously only available via npx.

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-05-03

### Changed — Multi-Plugin Coexistence (Removed All Global Hooks)

Audit of the v3.0 install footprint surfaced the same issue that prompted ContentForge v3.9.0 and SocialForge v1.5.0 the same day: Claude Code plugin hooks fire *globally* when the plugin is enabled. There is no per-directory or per-project scoping. DMP's four prior hooks were particularly problematic because one of them — the `PreToolUse mcp_.*` matcher — intercepted EVERY MCP tool call from EVERY installed plugin (Slack, Notion, GitHub MCP, Stripe, anything), forcing a brand-compliance LLM evaluation on every MCP write regardless of whether it had any connection to marketing work.

#### Removed All 4 Global Hooks

[hooks/hooks.json](hooks/hooks.json) now contains an empty `hooks: {}` object plus a `_readme` explaining the rationale. The four prior hooks are preserved with per-hook rationale notes at [hooks/hooks-reference.example.json](hooks/hooks-reference.example.json):

- **SessionStart** — ran `python3 scripts/setup.py --check-deps --summary` on every Claude Code launch in every project. Now run on demand.
- **PreToolUse Write|Edit** — large brand-compliance + hallucination-check prompt fired on every file edit. Compliance and hallucination checks already run inside the agents responsible for generating the marketing content; the hook was a duplicate execution layer with a SKIP guard that still cost a model invocation per edit.
- **PreToolUse mcp_.\*** — the worst offender. Gated every MCP tool call from every plugin through DMP's brand-compliance prompt. A user installing DMP alongside other MCP-using plugins (which is common) saw this prompt fire on every Slack message, every Notion page write, every GitHub PR creation, etc. — even when those operations had nothing to do with marketing. Per-agent decision flows already require explicit user approval for marketing MCP writes.
- **SessionEnd** — insight-saving prompt for marketing work, fired at every session end. Insight capture should be opt-in (run the engagement orchestrator), not automatic.

#### Why It Matters

The mcp_.* matcher meant DMP was effectively becoming a global gatekeeper for every MCP tool call across the user's entire Claude Code installation. That is far beyond DMP's scope of authority. Removing it fixes the most acute multi-plugin coexistence problem in the marketing plugin family.

#### Behavior Preserved

All compliance checks, brand voice enforcement, MCP write approvals, and dependency setup still run — they were always also encoded in the agent files, the engagement orchestrator, and the per-agent decision flows. The hook layer was a duplicate execution path. Removing it produces identical output quality with zero side-effects on other Claude Code work or other installed plugins.

### Migration

No breaking changes to commands, skills, agents, or production behavior. Brand profiles, engagement state, tracking data, and the v3.0 12-Part Methodology are all preserved. If you specifically want a hook back, copy the relevant entry from `hooks/hooks-reference.example.json` into `hooks/hooks.json` — but be aware that the `mcp_.*` matcher will gate every MCP call from every installed plugin.

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added — The 12-Part Engagement Methodology

Major release introducing a sequential engagement workflow that transforms the plugin from a catalog of 141 atomic skills into a methodology-driven engagement system. Every brand engagement now runs through 12 canonical parts producing ~50–60 files in a defined structure.

#### New Methodology Layer

- **12-Part Strategy Flow** — sequential engagement workflow from intake through continuous improvement (`skills/context-engine/engagement-flow-methodology.md`)
- **Four Core Documents** — the strategic spine produced in Part 3 with 61 explicit steps across 3.1 Business & SBU Analysis (18 steps), 3.2 Segmentation Framework (15 steps), 3.3 Brand Positioning & Communications (19 steps), 3.4 DMFlow (9 steps) (`skills/context-engine/four-core-documents-spec.md`)
- **Two-Views Model** — v1 unbiased market view + v2 client-validated view; both kept forever for different decision types (`skills/context-engine/two-views-model.md`)
- **Stone vs Opinion intake** — every Part 1 fact tagged with confidence level; Stone facts treated as ground truth, Opinion hypotheses become research questions (`skills/context-engine/stone-vs-opinion.md`)
- **Decision Matrix for v2 Re-runs** — explicit mapping of client validation responses to which Core Documents need re-running (`skills/context-engine/decision-matrix-rerun.md`)
- **Update-Back Rule** — versioning protocol (v2.1, v2.2 etc.) for in-life corrections after Part 7+ (`skills/context-engine/update-back-rule.md`)
- **Living Project Instruction File** — single source of truth per engagement that all skills read first (`skills/context-engine/living-instruction-file-spec.md`)

#### New Strategic Framework References (15 docs)

- **Five Digital Markets** — Search / Profile / Contextual / Marketplace / Utility taxonomy (`skills/context-engine/five-digital-markets.md`)
- **Channel Families** — 7 families covering 17 channels for Part 9 (`skills/context-engine/channel-families.md`)
- **In-Market vs Out-Market** — 3-5% vs 95-97% audience split, budget allocation logic (`skills/context-engine/in-market-out-market.md`)
- **Multi-Dimensional Decision Framework** — weight + score + weighted total for any consequential decision (`skills/context-engine/decision-framework.md`)
- **Unit Economics Framework** — CAC / LTV / LTV:CAC ≥ 3.0 / payback period; foundation for all recommendations (`skills/context-engine/unit-economics-framework.md`)
- **Actionable Persona Format** — 6-question format replacing biographical narratives (`skills/context-engine/actionable-persona-format.md`)
- **B2B Decision-Making Unit** — User / Influencer / Decision-maker / Gatekeeper roles with role-specific messaging (`skills/context-engine/b2b-decision-making-unit.md`)
- **Three-Scenario Forecasting** — Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive for every projection (`skills/context-engine/three-scenario-forecasting.md`)
- **30 / 60 / 90-Day Framework** — Foundation / Validation / Optimisation phasing (`skills/context-engine/30-60-90-framework.md`)
- **Reporting Cadence** — daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly / annual scopes and audiences (`skills/context-engine/reporting-cadence.md`)
- **Fixed vs Variable Budget** — Fixed monthly + Variable reserve mechanism with monthly recommendation conversation (`skills/context-engine/fixed-vs-variable-budget.md`)
- **Competitor 3-Question Output** — what they do well / poorly / are NOT doing — enforced output for every competitor analysis (`skills/context-engine/competitor-3-question-output.md`)
- **India Market Context** — regional context module (DPDP Act, mobile-first, festive seasonality, WhatsApp, vernacular content, INR pricing benchmarks, tier-1/2/3 differentiation) (`skills/context-engine/india-market-context.md`)
- **Growth Plan Template** — canonical 11-section structure for the Part 8 flagship deliverable (`skills/context-engine/growth-plan-template.md`)
- **Yearly Planner Template** — canonical structure for the 12-month operational companion (`skills/context-engine/yearly-planner-template.md`)
- **Monthly Report Template** — 9-section structure with writing principles enforcing insight over data (`skills/context-engine/monthly-report-template.md`)

#### New Engagement Skills (6)

- `engagement-workflow` — the 12-Part orchestrator that owns engagement lifecycle
- `four-core-documents` — produces all 4 Part 3 documents (61 steps); supports `--view v2` for re-runs
- `client-validation-document` — produces the Part 5 deliverable (the "one true stop")
- `growth-plan` — produces the Part 8 flagship 11-section client deliverable
- `yearly-planner` — produces the Part 8 operational 12-month companion
- `continuous-improvement-loop` — Part 12 quarterly briefs and ad-hoc briefs aggregating market + operating signals into product/offering recommendations

#### New Command

- `/digital-marketing-pro:engagement` — entry point with subcommands: `start`, `status`, `next`, `validate`, `re-run-decision`, `update-back`, `lif-show`, `file-tree`, `list-engagements`, `four-core`, `growth-plan`, `yearly-planner`, `loop`

#### New Persistence Script

- `scripts/engagement-state.py` — manages the engagement state, directory tree, Stone/Opinion intake, Decision Matrix evaluation, Update-Back versioning, Living Project Instruction File. 14 subcommands with JSON I/O for skill consumption. Atomic writes; no hand-editing of `_engagement.json` required.

#### New Engagement Directory Structure

Every engagement now lives at:
```
~/.claude-marketing/brands/{brand-slug}/engagements/{engagement-id}/
```
With a canonical 12-part directory tree, v1/v2 split for Parts 3 and 4, persistent reports directory, and the Living Project Instruction File.

#### Plugin Manifest Modernised to 2026 Spec

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` updated with:
- `$schema` reference for JSON schema validation
- `homepage` and `repository` URLs
- `license` field
- Expanded `keywords` array for marketplace discovery
- Author URL added

### Compatibility

- **All existing v2.7.0 skills, agents, scripts, hooks remain functional and unchanged.** v3.0 is purely additive at the methodology layer.
- The 12-Part workflow uses existing skills as Part-specific producers (e.g., Part 4 uses existing `competitor-analysis`, `audience-intelligence`, `market-intelligence`).
- Engagements are an opt-in workflow. Single-skill invocations (e.g., `/digital-marketing-pro:content-engine` for a one-off blog post) continue to work without an engagement context.

### Migration

No migration needed. Existing brand profiles at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json` continue to work. Engagements are new directories that sit alongside the existing brand state.

To start using the new methodology:
```
/digital-marketing-pro:engagement start <your-brand-slug> <your-engagement-id>
```

## [2.7.0] — 2026-03-31

### Changed — Skill Budget, Agent Safety, Execution Safety

Structural quality release addressing plugin best practice audit. No feature changes — all existing functionality preserved.

#### Skill Description Optimization (141 skills)

- All 141 descriptions trimmed to <130 characters (from 130-400+) to fit within the ~15,500 char skill discovery budget
- Preserves trigger intent: "[Verb] [domain]. Use when: [triggers]." pattern
- Previously 140/141 skills exceeded convention — Claude may not have discovered all skills

#### Agent Safety (25 agents)

- `maxTurns` added to all 25 agents — prevents runaway execution
- 10 turns (5 agents), 15 turns (15 agents), 20 turns (5 agents)

#### Execution Safety

- `disable-model-invocation: true` added to `launch-plan` (total: 18 protected skills)

#### Hook Stability

- SessionStart: `timeout 30` wrapper on setup.py prevents session hang

---

## [2.6.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added — SEO Capability Expansion

Closes the gap with dedicated SEO tools by adding 6 new SEO sub-skills, expanded schema markup support, reference documentation, and a new MCP integration. Inspired by capabilities identified in [claude-seo](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo) — adapted to work within the full marketing system architecture with brand context, execution layer, multi-client support, and quality evaluation.

#### New Skills (6)

- **`/digital-marketing-pro:programmatic-seo`** — Programmatic SEO at scale: data source assessment, template engine planning, URL pattern strategy, internal linking automation, thin content safeguards with quality gates (WARNING at 100 pages, HARD STOP at 500), index bloat prevention, and Google's Scaled Content Abuse policy enforcement (June 2025 / August 2025 escalation context)
- **`/digital-marketing-pro:competitor-pages`** — SEO-optimized competitor comparison page generator: "X vs Y" pages, "alternatives to X" pages, "best tools" roundup pages, feature matrix tables. Includes Product/SoftwareApplication/ItemList schema markup, conversion-optimized CTA layouts, keyword targeting formulas, fairness guidelines, and social proof integration
- **`/digital-marketing-pro:image-seo-audit`** — Dedicated image optimization audit: alt text quality, tiered file size thresholds (thumbnail/content/hero), format analysis (WebP/AVIF/JPEG XL status), responsive images (`srcset`/`sizes`), lazy loading validation (flags `loading="lazy"` on LCP images), `fetchpriority="high"` checks, `decoding="async"`, CLS prevention via dimensions, file naming, CDN usage
- **`/digital-marketing-pro:page-analysis`** — Deep single-page SEO analysis: all ranking dimensions for one URL (title, meta, headings, content depth, E-E-A-T, schema detection with deprecation tracking, images, internal links, technical signals, AI search readiness). More granular than site-wide `/digital-marketing-pro:seo-audit`. Use for landing page optimization, content refresh prioritization, or pre-publish quality checks
- **`/digital-marketing-pro:sitemap`** — XML sitemap analysis and generation: parse existing sitemaps for issues (stale lastmod, 404s, noindex conflicts, missing URLs, protocol limit violations), or generate new sitemaps with industry-specific templates (SaaS, ecommerce, local, publisher, agency). Includes sitemap index strategy, robots.txt registration, and compression recommendations
- **`/digital-marketing-pro:seo-plan`** — Comprehensive SEO strategy planning with industry-specific templates: discovery, competitive analysis, architecture design, content strategy, technical foundation, and 4-phase implementation roadmap (Foundation → Expansion → Scale → Authority). Templates for SaaS, ecommerce, local service, publisher/media, and agency business models

#### New Reference Files (2)

- **`schema-templates.json`** — Ready-to-use JSON-LD template library with 12 schema types: VideoObject, BroadcastEvent (LIVE badge), Clip (key moments), SeekToAction (video seek), SoftwareSourceCode, ProductGroup (e-commerce variants), ProfilePage (E-E-A-T), Certification (replaced EnergyConsumptionDetails), OfferShippingDetails, MerchantReturnPolicy, SoftwareApplication, ItemList. Includes deprecation tracker for HowTo (Sept 2023), FAQ (Aug 2023), SpecialAnnouncement (July 2025), EnergyConsumptionDetails (April 2025)
- **`google-seo-reference.md`** — Concise Google SEO quick reference for agents: Search Essentials, E-E-A-T framework (with December 2025 update extending to all competitive queries), Core Web Vitals (INP current, FID removed), schema markup status table, image SEO best practices, AI search optimization signals, spam policies including Scaled Content Abuse and Site Reputation Abuse

#### Updated — schema-generator.py

- **9 new schema types** added: BroadcastEvent, Clip, SeekToAction, SoftwareSourceCode, SoftwareApplication, ProductGroup, ProfilePage, Certification, ItemList, plus dedicated builder functions for each
- **Deprecation warnings** — Automatic warnings when generating HowTo or FAQPage schemas, citing deprecation dates and recommending alternatives
- Total supported types: 18 (was 9)

#### Updated — seo-specialist Agent

- References new skills (programmatic-seo, competitor-pages, image-seo-audit, page-seo-analysis, sitemap-manager, seo-plan) with invocation guidance
- References new reference files (google-seo-reference.md, schema-templates.json)

#### New MCP Integration

- **DataForSEO** — Live SERP data, keyword research, backlink profiles, on-page analysis, content analysis, competitor domain analysis, AI visibility checking, LLM mention tracking. 9 API modules. Added to `.mcp.json.example` with `DATAFORSEO_USERNAME` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` environment variables

### Summary

| Metric | Before (v2.5.1) | After (v2.6.0) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Skills | 135 | 141 |
| Schema types in generator | 9 | 18 |
| SEO-specific commands | ~14 | ~20 |
| MCP integrations | 67 | 68 |
| Reference files | 146 | 148 |

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-03-05

### Added — Skill Platform Enhancements

- **`argument-hint`** added to all 55 user-invocable skills — provides autocomplete hints in the Skills UI (e.g., `[URL]`, `[brand-name --full]`, `[competitor1, competitor2, ...]`)
- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** added to 17 execution skills — prevents Claude from auto-triggering skills that write to external platforms (publish, send, launch, import, export). Users must explicitly invoke these via `/digital-marketing-pro:skill-name`
- **`evals/evals.json`** added to 3 key skills (campaign-plan, seo-audit, content-engine) — structured test cases with prompts, expected outputs, and quantitative/qualitative assertions for quality benchmarking
- **Fixed** `/digital-marketing-pro:help` skill — added missing `name: help` field in frontmatter (required by Agent Skills spec for skill registration)

### How it works

**Argument hints** appear as placeholder text when a user types `/digital-marketing-pro:` in the Skills UI, showing what arguments each skill accepts. For example, `/digital-marketing-pro:seo-audit` shows `[URL]` and `/digital-marketing-pro:campaign-plan` shows `[product/service description --budget=N]`.

**Execution safety** ensures that skills which write to external platforms (like `/digital-marketing-pro:publish-blog`, `/digital-marketing-pro:send-email-campaign`, `/digital-marketing-pro:launch-ad-campaign`) cannot be triggered by Claude autonomously — the user must explicitly type the slash command. This is a critical safety layer on top of the existing MCP write approval hook.

**Evals** provide reproducible test cases for key skills. Each eval includes a realistic prompt, expected output description, and assertions that can be verified programmatically. Located at `skills/{skill-name}/evals/evals.json`.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added — Commands & Version Consistency

- **7 command files** in `commands/` directory — visible in the Customize panel "Commands" section:
  - `brand-setup` — Set up a new brand profile with voice, audience, competitors, and compliance rules
  - `campaign-plan` — Generate a multi-channel campaign plan with objectives, audience, budget, and KPIs
  - `seo-audit` — Run a comprehensive SEO audit covering technical, on-page, content, E-E-A-T, and link profile
  - `content-engine` — Draft blog posts, ad copy, emails, social, landing pages, and video scripts
  - `performance-report` — Generate marketing performance reports with KPI tracking and anomaly detection
  - `competitor-analysis` — Multi-dimensional competitive analysis across content, SEO, ads, social, and AI visibility
  - `email-sequence` — Design complete email sequences with subject lines, timing, and deliverability guidance
- **New `/digital-marketing-pro:help` skill** — Quick reference with all commands, examples, and troubleshooting

### Fixed

- Updated stale version references across docs (getting-started.md, architecture.md, integrations-guide.md) from v2.2.0/v2.4.0 to v2.5.0

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-02-25

### Added — Connector Discovery & Onboarding

- **New `/digital-marketing-pro:integrations` skill** — Status dashboard showing all connected vs available MCP connectors, grouped by category (CRM, SEO, advertising, email, social, etc.), with which skills each connector unlocks and quick-win recommendations
- **New `/digital-marketing-pro:connect` skill** — Guided setup for connecting specific services (e.g., `/digital-marketing-pro:connect google-ads`). Provides platform-specific credential instructions, `.mcp.json` configuration, and post-setup verification. Handles HTTP (OAuth) vs npx (API key) connectors differently
- **New `connector-status.py` script** — Backend for connector discovery. Maintains a registry of 45+ connectors across 17 categories, checks `.mcp.json` and environment variables to report connection status, and generates setup guides
- **Updated `CONNECTORS.md`** — Added "Managing connectors" section linking to `/digital-marketing-pro:integrations`, `/digital-marketing-pro:connect`, `/digital-marketing-pro:add-integration`, and `/digital-marketing-pro:credential-switch` skills

### How it works

Users can now discover and manage integrations interactively:
- `/digital-marketing-pro:integrations` — "What's connected? What can I add?"
- `/digital-marketing-pro:connect salesforce` — "Walk me through connecting Salesforce"
- `/digital-marketing-pro:add-integration` — "I have a custom MCP server to add"

All 14 HTTP connectors auto-load on install (Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, etc.) and authenticate via OAuth on first use. The 45+ npx connectors are discoverable through these skills and require API keys.

Skills that depend on connectors already handle missing connections gracefully — they check for connectivity at startup and guide users to setup if not connected.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Added missing YAML frontmatter to `localization-specialist.md` and `quality-assurance.md` agents — without frontmatter, these agents failed to register during plugin installation, potentially causing installation rollback

## [2.3.0] — 2026-02-25

### Changed — HTTP Connector Architecture

This release rebuilds the MCP integration layer to follow Anthropic's official plugin pattern — HTTP-only connectors that work in both Cowork and Claude Code.

- **New `.mcp.json` with 14 HTTP connectors**: Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Ahrefs, Similarweb, Klaviyo, Google Calendar, Gmail, Stripe, Asana, Webflow — all `"type": "http"`, all work through Cowork's VM NAT
- **New `CONNECTORS.md`** documenting 12 connector categories with `~~category` placeholder pattern (matching Anthropic's official convention)
- **`.mcp.json.example` preserved** for Claude Code users who want the full 67-server npx configuration
- **Minimal `plugin.json`** — stripped to 4 fields (name, version, description, author) matching Anthropic's official plugin format. Removed non-standard fields: `author.title`, `author.organization`, `author.email`, `author.work_email`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`
- **Script path resolution** — `setup.py` now outputs the plugin root and scripts directory path at session start, so Claude can resolve relative script paths in both Cowork and Claude Code

### Environment Compatibility

| Feature | Cowork | Claude Code |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| 115 skills, 25 agents | Full | Full |
| HTTP connectors (14) | Full | Full |
| npx/stdio servers (67) | Not available | Full (via .mcp.json.example) |
| Python scripts (64) | Works (Python 3.10 in VM) | Full |
| Persistent brand data | Per-session | Persistent |

## [2.2.1] — 2026-02-24

### Fixed — CLI Contract & Script Bugs
- **CRITICAL: Removed undefined `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` env var** from all 22+ SKILL.md files, 23 agent files, hooks.json, and 2 documentation files — replaced with relative `scripts/` paths that work across all environments
- **Fixed CLI argument mismatches in 8 SKILL.md files** where script invocation commands did not match actual argparse definitions:
  - eval-content: `--content`/`--type` → `--text`/`--content-type`, `--composite`/`--dimensions` → `--data '{json}'`
  - verify-claims: removed non-existent `--brand` flag, `--content` → `--text`
  - validate-output: removed non-existent `--brand` flag, `--content` → `--text`, `--action detect-schema` → `--action list-schemas`
  - translate-content: `--content` → `--text`, `--source-lang`/`--target-lang` → `--source`/`--target`/`--original`/`--translated`, removed non-existent `--language`
  - localize-campaign: `--content` → `--text`, removed non-existent `--language`
  - eval-suite: `--content` → `--text`, quality-tracker `--action log --content-label --scores --suite-id` → `--action log-eval --data '{json}'`
  - prompt-test: `--content` → `--text`
  - quality-report: `--type` → `--content-type`
- **Fixed content-scorer.py keyword density bug**: multi-word keywords used substring matching (`str.count()`) instead of word-boundary matching — "AI tools" would match inside "AI toolset". Now uses `re.findall()` with `\b` word boundaries
- **Fixed hallucination-detector.py sentence splitting bug**: `re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', ...)` split on abbreviation periods (Dr., Inc., U.S.) — now requires uppercase letter after split point: `(?<=[.!?])\s+(?=[A-Z])`
- **Fixed hooks.json SessionStart**: replaced fragile compound shell command with nested subshells and `2>/dev/null` (Unix-only) with simple `python scripts/setup.py --check-deps --summary`
- **Fixed custom-mcp-guide.md**: stale "46 MCP servers" count updated to 67

### Fixed — ContentForge Plugin
- **Added YAML frontmatter** (`name` + `description`) to all 10 agent files for Claude Cowork routing compatibility
- **Replaced 5 invented MCP tool names** in Output Manager agent (`mcp_google-drive_list_folders`, `mcp_google-drive_create_folder`, `mcp_google-drive_upload_file`, `mcp_google-sheets_read_row`, `mcp_google-sheets_update_row`) with adaptive MCP approach that checks available tools at runtime

### Changed
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md verification checklist to reference `scripts/` instead of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
- Updated docs/architecture.md agent template to reference `scripts/` instead of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
